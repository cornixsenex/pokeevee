	//Under the spell of Clytemnestra, needs Oresetes help to recover. Orestes, pursued by the 3 ghosts runs madly through the forest. Once the furies are vanquished he will show you the secret way into Agamemnon's palace where you together battle Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. Once defeated the spell is broken and Agamemnon is freed from the spell. Orestes' ghost re-appear to torment him for his deed. They can be defeated again and he will return to be at peace in the house of Agamemnon.

He tells you to stay back, attacks when you get near, then tells his tale. Abandoned there to die and in desperate need of medicine. Bring him the medicine and he will depart
//Tiresies / Calchas
	//With Oedipus, will leave after odipus does his thing

//Hektor
	//In beach cave training to be stronger. Returns without a fight.
//Alexandros
	//In hiding with his beloved helen. A wild bull attacks which he yokes, the people exclaim that none but the great Alexandros, prince paris, could have done such a thing. When confronted he immediately goes to Nestor in fear. Helen attacks refusing to return to her husband but relents after defeat.
//Aeneis
	//On Lavinian shores! Arms and the boys of whom I cry!
	//Aeneis recognizes the authority of Nestor and wishes to return but admits his obligation to the pythia who told him to found a city here, and to his family, is higher. On the shore Aeneis runs up and down saying his twin grandsons have gone missing for days. He and his son, Faustulus, don't have much hope but he refuses to rest until they are found. In the Lupercal Cave (deep?) you find the boys and the wolf. Upon approach the boys retread and mama approaches. She growls as you approach and if you get too close she attacks. After being defeated or captured Faustulus will enter and exclaim with joy at the discover of his boys and bring them home where you will find Aeneis ready to meet Nestory. Faustulus makes some joke about how the twins are constantly fighting with eachother but that the auspices are good, a great city will be built and his descendants shall inherit the earth.

	-After peace treaty the govenorship is dissolved (govenor would have fled during attack of Nappy and hid with the Merchant Guild later being stripped of his duties but allowed to go home - he was just a minor noble friend of the King so he dissapeared into the ether or maybe not but it wasn't hereditary so it doesn't really matter)

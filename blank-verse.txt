#NOTE#
	>The idea here is to just have a place to write the actual verses for Sibylline Book III. I need a script to convert these raw text strings into the appropiate format for use in the project. IE add the declaration, the _("") shit and the {PAUSE_UNTIL_PRESS} and everything. Possibly I want an intro something like "The lines written in burning coal pour off the page" or whatever. Probably also want it to auto-format so have the script count characters if its 30 do \n if it's 60 do \p etc etc
	>Max is ~34 characters but it needs to check spaces too because I don't want words broken up into separate lines

#NOTE#
	>The idea here is to just have a place to write the actual verses for Sibylline Book III. I need a script to convert these raw text strings into the appropiate format for use in the project. IE add the declaration, the _("") shit and the {PAUSE_UNTIL_PRESS} and everything. Possibly I want an intro something like "The lines written in burning coal pour off the page" or whatever. Probably also want it to auto-format so have the script count characters if its 30 do \n if it's 60 do \p etc etc
	>Max is ~34 characters but it needs to check spaces too because I don't want words broken up into separate lines

-- START --
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
Eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum.

Upon four-legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides.
The lamppost stands with folded arms, its iron claws attached.

All along the watchtower princes kept the view while all the women came and went barefoot servants, too.

Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.

>Mythic Era
	Current Era
	Man made apocolypse
	Few fallout survivors
	Mew births mons and appears to people that it's OK
	People awaken in (Islands, Pyramids, any other mysterious, ancient ruin)

>Prehistoric Era
	People spread across the earth 
		Mountain people spread across the coast and plains
		Island people spread across the Islands
	People depend on mons for survival and domesticate the first ones (Normal ones like Tuaros, Milktank, Pidgey etc)
		Plains eat Tauros
		Desert eat Cacnea
		Coast eats fisha
	Island never domesticate mons but eat and sacrifice them
	Religion is developed
		Desert mysticism: daily regular prayer, pilgrimage, militarism
		Coastal mew monotheism
		Island savage mon warship and sacrifice
	Agriculture is slowly developed
		Probably first up in Tucson farming Canea and later but independantly in the plains herding Tauros and growing yknow sunflora or whatever
		Islanders never develop agriculture because of abundunt food source

>Anceint Era
	Mainland have developed into grouped city states 
		>Tucson
		>Troy
		>Gato
		>East Bay
		>Willow
		>West Vegas
		>Vegas
		>Pyramids
		>Uni
		>Church Oasis
	Gato and Tucson independantly begin to use mons for Warefare
		>Gato quickly consolodates power over the southern coast
		>Tucson comes to be the central oasis in the eastern valley area
	Gato takes Troy but leaves the royal family on the throne (intermarriage ends the conflict)
	East bay resists but is leveled and a govenor installed
	City Clara surrenders on contact accepting that things are ordered the way they are ordered (render unto caesar) and being content to live in pious peace in friendship and under protection of Gato

>Kingdom
	The Kingdom of Gato is offical when Gato has control over what they consider the entire earth
		>King Gato
			>Prince Troy
			>Govenor Bay
			>Bishop Clara
	In this time the Khanif find Shiny mon (like black meteor steel yknow like black chrzard or whatever) and unites the oasis under his banner
	Sudden Flame
		Desert now united marches secretly through passes through the mountains and attacks the unaware and unprepared kingdom.
		Battle of Sudden Flame the farms were burned and East Bay was destroyed (again!)
		Knights were pushed back to the fortresses of Montgomery and Troy
	The siege
		Sea travel was invented here to deliver messages from Clara, Montgomery, and Gato during the siege
		In this time even the Clerics of Clara came to war 
		Battle Dagorath (Graveyard) the great battle was fought where Ultimately the water and psychic types brought by Clara were the deciding factor
		the desert people fled back over the mountains.
	The Watchful Peace
		Passes across the mountains watched by both sides
		Neither side belives they have the power to take the other
		Eventually an uneasy peace is reached and trade begins, first between soldiers, then by the states themselves.

>Exploration
	Colonization
		A northern merchant company who was logging and looking for a way to sail around Montgomery and evade paying them transit tax ventured too far south and discovered the Islands landing on Nihau
		He discoverd new mons and found the islands full of food / resources / berries idk
		The natives were also unorganized and lacked any mons for protection or production
		Eventually the Merchant Company comes to control the islands with the natives all working on their factories and plantations and Aldeon becomes a rich city
		Recognized by the crown as Doge or CEO or whatever
	Fall of Desert Khanif - Lotus War
		Meanwhile Kingdom has been trading water / food / mons for stone from the mountains with the desert people. General sentiment among the Desert people is they're exploiting Gato by trading them worthless stones for goods but Gato used them to build buildings
		Doge floods the market with Lotus
		King forbids it's sale in his lands 
		Doge invests great sums in the Vegas market eventually taking much of the place for himself
		Tucson likewise gets hooked in a very short time before the Khanif knows what's happening
		Only weeks later he sees his people have become hooked on Lotus and tries to ban it but the people and the merchant operatives revolt
		Kingdom senses weakness and sees opprotunity and invades via all routes
		Tucson falls very quickly as the people are all Lotus heads and gotten fat and gluttonous buying all the imported island goods
	Post Peace Desert
		Peace is Khanif retains control over his territory (which is just the uni and tucson and church now) but the rebellious one is exiled and his relative (who is a total glutton and lotus head) is put in power. In addition all imported goods and all immigrants from the kingdom are allowed. They also must de-militarize completely
		Flood of migrants from Gato City arrive in Tucson to attend the Uni and settle there
		Violent sects of desert people remain but are slowly pushed out of society. It's gradual.
		In their religion they must make a pilgrimage to the holy oasis every year so every year during rough periods there's conflict over that. Between the violent sects who went to live in the badlands caves slabs and the church which is in tucson under control of the gluttunous Khanif who enforces the White Gold Concordant.
		Majority of the desert people just turn into lotus heads (super processed lotus too not pure leaf) and abandon their traditions and just mine rocks
		Population becomes like 99% coastal people in Uni, 30% in Tucson, 80% Vegas

>Great War / Revolution
	A great plague descends on the land
		>Caused by colonization. PKRUS is one of them. Islanders affected on islands and crops and mons affected on mainland
	AQ becomes active in desert again
	Commy Uni groups become active in desert and Gato
	The people of Gato and Tucson both have demonstrations
	Military (still knights) called in to suppress the revolters but many feel sympathy for their cause and their republican ideals
	During this period the King is oblivious to the needs of the people (Marie Antoinette)
	He goes on vacation to see his friend / cousing Dux Troy (Nestor?)
	Here is Bastille event where many Knights join with the mob
	Mob storms castle. 
	It's a mob with evolving demands
	Mob marches on Castle Troy
	Mob demands evolve:
		>Bring demands (food) to King
		>See King in person
		>Speak to king face to face
		>Bring King back to Gato
	Surrounded in Troy the Dux tries to caution the King but King is unaware and believes the people will be good to him. He has no fear and goes out.
	The mob surrounds him and the king is beheaded and brought back to the capital on a pike
	Under the pike the first Assembly is born in the capital (same capital?)
	Royal farms and food siezed which provides them with food for the time being
	GOV of the revolution:
		King
		Mob
		Assembly
		Directory (5 men above assembly to deal with crises)
		Consulate / Napoleon (Consul above a senate (reduced assembly of only elders))
		Republic (Senate et President)
	Parties of the revolution:
		Commies - abolition, atheism, abolition of private property etc
		Jacobins - universal sufferage, republicans,

Over educated Uni people want a republican government and the idea speads to the city when they go home
	Crop failure causes Desert people to come into the plain again and city people riot without beer and bread
	During this period the disconnected and innefective King decides to visit his friend the Duke of Troy
	While he's gone the Riot of Gato breaks out and the Palace is stormed and the guard barracks overrun and a mob takes over Gato.
	In the confusion republican groups in the desert enter and try to push for republic
	Military, EastBay and Troy resist but finally a deal is struck: The kind agrees to resign in exchange a republic will be formed and govern the city but the other leaders will remain in control of their territories and the King will be allowed to remain in Troy
	The two sides agree but conflict erupts again when The King is killed when he returns to Gato to retrieve his things (or something)
	New tech like Technical Machines (war purpose moves) and balls see the greatest war rage for years.
	Finally at the end the radicals won with help from the merchant guild

>Modern era
	A republic is proclaimed and all land owning men can vote and send representatives to the capital
	Gato continues to dominate because of population.
	Island is fully owned by the Merchants so islanders have no representation
	Troy agrees to the tax but does not get involved much in outside politics
	Nestor already didn't care much so doesn't protest much
	Economy still destroyed and people starvinga
	First election sees General Hindenburg elected (guy who led the rebel army)
	He's pretty bad at what he does but generally well liked
	Restoration Part with slogan "Peace, Land and Bread" quickly gains power under leadership of Vader who came from up north with ties to the Merchants but gained complete power over the government
		>Built Roads
		>Fixed economy
		>Industrialized farming
		>Secret Police (Rocket Black Shirts)
	Vader serves two consecutive terms before stepping aside for the same guy who ran before him but the reigns of power are all controlled by Restiz and they're by far the majority party with Hindenburg even joining them before being elected
	Restiz plan to connect Slabs, Clara, and eventually Bulbus to the highway system and thereby destroy their sense of autonomy but during the first two terms the most important were the Farm Road (which helped the crisis) and the Tucson Road which helped end the long standing sense of Desert Seperatisma
	During this new period of peace many technological innovations are made like
		>Bicycles
		>Balls
		>Storage system
		>Boats?

>Game story
	Mew appears during a mysterious storm and arrives at the church in City Clara
	People from all over are drawn and come to worship
	Restiz party immediatly close the church when they arrive and strongly deny any mon presence but warn there's a dangerous situation going on
	Blaine (Restiz scientist) arrives and captues mew in the master ball
	Mew is taken back to restiz tower and expirimented on, the goal is to create a version of Mew which will do battle for them
	Many expiriments fail and result in Dittos
	As this takes place the descendant of the King returns and begins spreading propaganda about the restoration of the monarchy as common people become dissilusioned with the republic and see that things are really being ran by the party which is ran by Vader who isn't even a Gato man to begin with.
	Expirimentations are rushed and finally a hail mary is thrown where instead of clonin Mew they simply change it's DNA or whatever to create a more powerful version. Fearful that they will be able to control this creature a suit of armor is designed as inspired by master ball technology which they hope will force it to be controllable.
	Upon awakening there is an accident getting it into the armor but eventually they suceed
	Only short time of testing is possible during which it's not completely confirmed M2 will obey them in a battle but suddenly
	SIEGE!
		The returned King Indianus Maximus has freed the prisoners and flooded the city. Angry peasants have taken up arms as well as the military, police, and black shirts scramble to protect the capital
		A royalist spy (player) infiltrates the rocket building and Vader himself takes M2 and flees to the Capital
		At the capital he demands Hindenburg declare a state of emergency and asks the senate to vote him dictator which they do
		The rebels break down the door as Vader assumes the dictatorship, now legally in charge he is ready to unleash M2
		M2 refuses to obey and breaks the armor leaving them all
		The military says they must evacuate and flee to Fort Montgomery
	Restoration of the Monarchy
	King Indianus Maximus is proclaimed by scared Hindenburg and the senate. King Indianus' first act is to dissolve the senate and raise an army to defeat the traitors.
	Most people don't really care new boss same as the old boss
	Pirates and Raiders return to the Highways and Seas. Merchants still pull the strings
	Since masses aren't enlisting but also aren't resisting a spy is sent into the fort where military men start to mutiny. M2 has been located hiding on the top of a mountain and Vader goes with top brass and Blaine to catch him in last ditch attempt
	At Mountain top M2 rages that if he can't be left alone he will destroy all the world says he is master of the world. To prove his superiority (and therefore right to destroy everything) he invites all the strongest trainers to his island tower fortress (which he just created) to try and stop him, otherwise he will end everything
	Miraculously he is stopped by player and
	Mew re-appears and brings back your granny
	FIN

>Post Story
	Merchants end up buying everything and turing everyone into renters and wage slaves just like the islanders

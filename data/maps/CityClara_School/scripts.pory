It's a marvellous convenience and the company offers many boxes for free to all trainers. In order to access the Pokemon Box System you will need an internet connection.

If an inexperienced trainer tries to command a powerful Pokemon the Pokemon may decide to disobey orders completely. All Pokemon Trainer School graduates recieve a Pokemon Trainer Card which will help you keep track of your skill as a trainer and determine the capacity of the strength of the Pokemon you will be able to command.

In the long ago Titans terrorized the earth. Earth,Air,Water,Fire+RayQuaza. Mew sealed them away and left shrines as guardians over the imprisoned. Over time people forgot the work of the guardians but they carry on. Mew's return awoke the Titans who had slumbered long however their prisons remain shut

The PARTY outlaws religion, alleges Mythic Pokemon aren't real. They win the war but Mew appears as a sign. The party capture mew with a master ball and distort it into MEWTWO. They use MEWTWO to destroy the 6 shrines and take over the 7th.

	>somewhere LEAF is involved. She blurts it out somewhere.
	
Here's the deal, Leaf shows up when you first arrive at ardor university. She says everyone is talking strange but you need to find Proffessor Indiana she suggests registering for classes might help then walks off. Indy's door IS open. Inside a TA greets you and tells you he's off at they pyramids. Inside pyramids they tell you he's at the top but to get there will be a struggle (strength and bike required. Maybe the bandits tell you IDK) Once defeated he tells you you're a promising archaeologist and to see him in his ffice.

 Then he says to meet him back at the office where Leaf busts in and blurts some shit out he curses her out and his students are revealed to be desert resistance. He tells you a plan to free the prisoners then initiate the attack. Prisoners are held deep underground in the dark cave lukily Indy has recovered a map and can find his way through for you but you'll need flash for him to help.

? Pokemon DIE in battle in canon!
	I like this idea actually, give the RIVAL a new team each time you fight him, maybe he picks the best from the last few routes you've went through. Have him start with a Ratatta and after the first battle you kill it but he brings it back as a gengar (at the graveyard!)

>Story

Opening is a TV thing with the announcer showing that Mew has returned.
Apocolypse! Big War has killed most people and now Mew has returned! People are begging repentance while others are embracing sin. 
older Brother is ASSHOLE
Grandma says he is to take you to the next town over to see Mew and she's too old to go
Says you will be allowed to choose PokeMon then gets into bed and dies (sleeps)
You little brother challenges you to a pokemon battle.
You find some PokeBalls on the road.
You (and your brother) walk to the next town over (or next BIG town over maybe)
You meet Sage of Mew in the next town over. Asks you about your parents why you're alone, seems sad. She's hot and says something about how you're special for some reason.
When you arrive there is a great crowd of people around the church. You find your brother who mocks you and says to go play in the trainer school since they can't get in anyway. After defeating the Evee lady (you shouldn't play with the other kids you're too strong) there's a big explosion
and you go out to find BigEvil along with Goons holdng a Rally scene thing. BigEvil Captured Mew and is declaring some empire of PokeMon. People are generally afraid, then your Brother gets up and joins them! BigEvil laughs and talks esotaric about becoming God or whatever and your brother tells you to join the party or you're dead to him. Babe tells you that the Party will try to take the power from all seven shrines and that someone must stop them. She say's they're headed to Under the Mountain and that you must go there to stop them.


It's your OLDER brother, he already has a PokeMon, he's not the first battle

The party has just won! After a long and gruelling war The Party announces that there is to be a great celebration in the capital.

Mew has appeared (after a cataclismac war) you and your brother are sent to go see it by your grandmother who is too old to go with you. She tells you to take care of your little bro. And sends you off with a PokeMon to protect you.


Mew appears in a smaller city near you, grandma sends you to go see it cuz muh religion and she dies leaves you with the dog Eevee. You arrive at the normal town, Big Crowd, bro saves your place, Gym 1, you come out, meet your bro at front of the line, go in, chapel warship mew shit, evil party breaks in steals mew, talk about some new world order shit. THEY have all the Master Balls. HQ == SF. Bro tells you he's going to join thm. Babe tells you that you need to stop them.

Mew gets taken by ASSHOLE whom you defeat BUT by knocking out mew you 
In mew's absence shit starts getting fucked


Mew has appeared at the church in the next town over. You are to escort your brother over with pokemon you borrow from PROF but he steals the mew and tries to battle you. In the process you KO mew and cause BigEvil to appear who take your brother who tries to defend mew. You discover the only way to save your bro is to gain the power of the sages and travel to the spirit realm where BigEvil lives.

>SIKE! They're in the basement

You enter the basement immediately after Mewtwo was chained. There should be some sense of panic. Blaine leads Mewtwo out and orders two scientists to stop you. You follow after him and find yourself in the Rocket Bunker. Giovanni is busy asking Blaine if he's sure Mewtwo is under control. Blaine sees you and suggests he use Mewtwo to destroy the player but Giovanni says the situation at the capital demands his attention. Loosing the tower now would be acceptable if he can take the capital. He orders Blaine to defend the bunker with his life and hurries down the tunell. Blaine engages with artificial pokemon mentioned above.

						>  1: Odysseus feigns madness. He has released his sheep and now keeps rocks in the pasture. He runs in circles muttering mumbo jumbo. His wife assures you he is quite insane. His son plays with the sheep but seems bored since his father won't play with him. He asks if you'd like to play hide and seek. When he's found he will either go to a new hiding spot, or return to the sheep. When he's in hiding if you speak with Penelope she will freak and go mad searching for her son, she will go to Ulysses who will then break character and agree to go to Nestor if you bring his boy back. Then when you find the boy when he returns to the sheep Ulysses will be with Penelope and will leave when you speak with him.
						>  2: Lotus Eaters - Ulysses is in the Lotus Grove on Maui and won't leave until you bring him some Kind Bud
						>  3: Cyclops - Bring Ulysses a sheeps skin while he's locked in the cave (take the back way since front way is blocked by Polyphemus) He will give you a Krater of wine, if you deliver that to Polyphemus he will drink it and then let the sheep out not noticing Ulysses imperfect disguise. Speak to Ulysses in the field with the Sheep in his disguise and he will depart. I think Polyphemus can play a part in another myth as well somewhere down the line.
						>  4: Circe - When you meet her she offers you a drink. If you drink it KO otherwise she attacks. After being defeated she will heal you in bed. When Ulysses arrives there will be a new pig NPC who if you interact with it while holding "Moly" it will transform into Ulysses...in fact all the animals should be interactable with 'Moly' Moly is a berry, or flower or herb not mota...or maybe mota.

						>  9: Shipwrecked on Phaeacia
							>Rescued from death by young girl Nausicaa (not many travelers make it out here we live forgotten from most people in huts on the water)
							>Says her father (Arete) would hear the story and give him provisions for the journey to Nestor
							>Back in the hut Ulysses re-tells the entire story up to this point

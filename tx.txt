With great rejoicing we welcome back the Dioscuri. Champion Castor and the proud Pollux were gone for far too long and only when they return to our house do we reflect on their great importance to the fortune and cheerof our estate. The beneficial {PLAYER} is deeply thanked for his assistance in bringing you back. You both were sorely missed. Now to address the reason we are gathered here today. It's my intention my Helen shall wed the one among us most suited to wed. Just as I did when I was just a youth, before the works of war had left me thus, I searched the whole country to discover someone in who to trust care of my house. Before, however, it was the lovely Leda I sought to wed whereas this time I sought the man whom my Helen will wed. Once I had interviewed hundreds of men, then spent hundreds of hours in debate over inherent traits, accomplishments, and astrologic signs I narrowed it to Paris of Troy and Menelaus the self made tycoon of commerce and trade. One of these two is my hand chosen heir and groom to my only daughter, Helen.
